# My Reading List  

This React Context *practice* project was started with the Net Ninja Tutorial video. Afterwards I added additional features, NoSQL database and authentication.  
- I implemented Firebase Firestore database for storing and retrieving book data  
- BookContext and bookReducer handle the application state of books  
- Firebase is also used for authentication with email and password (AuthContext)  

## This application is deployed to Firebase:
https://react-book-list-369d2.web.app/

You can create a new account or try the App with the following credentials:  
Email: testuser@email.com  
Password: Secret  

## Technologies used in this project:
- React.js
- React Router
- Firebase authentication
- Firebase Firestore database  
- Firebase hosting  
- React Bootstrap + Bootstrap
- ESLint
