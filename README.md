# My Reading List  

This React Context *practice* project was started with help of the Net Ninja Tutorial video. Afterwards I added some additional features, NoSQL database and authentication.  
- BookContext and bookReducer handle the application state of books
- I have implemented Firebase Firestore database for storing and retrieving book data  
- Firebase is also used for authentication with email and password
- AuthContext handles Firebase authentication requests and loggedUser state
